    The size and composition of the blood donation team can vary depending on the scale and scope of 
    the blood drive. In smaller blood drives, the medical director and phlebotomists may be the only 
    medical personnel involved, while in larger blood drives, the team may include multiple nurses, 
    phlebotomists, and support staff. The goal is to have a well-coordinated team that can provide 
    efficient and effective care to donors while ensuring the safety and quality of the donated blood.
